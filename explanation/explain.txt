This program is a stack-cli tool
that has the stack data structure
in a cli form.

it works with a prompt and 
by running commands.

commands:
    push  <value>    #this command push values into the stack.
    del   <value>    #this command deletes a value from the stack.
    find  <value>    #this commands shows you the index of a value.
    pop              #this command deletes the top element of the stack O(1).
    peek             #this command prints the top element of the stack O(1).
    print            #this command prints all the stack elements.
    count            #this commands shows you the total elements.
    swap             #this command swaps the top 2 elements.
    reverse          #this command reverses the stack.
    sort             #this command sorts the array by the quicksort algorithm. 
    help             #this commands shows you all the commands.
    cls              #this commands clears the terminal.
    exit             #this commands is for exiting the program.

Here is an example of the 
program running:

Prompt@~> push 10
Value 10 pushed into the stack
Prompt@~> push 30
Value 30 pushed into the stack
Prompt@~> print
Bottom->Top: 10 30
Prompt@~> exit
Exiting...

NOTES:
    you cant push the same value 2 times
    the swap command swaps the top 2 values
    the find command finds the index of the value in 0 based index rule
    sort uses quicksort to sort the elements
